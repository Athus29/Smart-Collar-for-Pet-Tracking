## Overview

The **Smart Collar** is a project designed to help track pets and ensure their safety using **GPS** and **GSM/GPRS** technologies. This project proposes the use of an **ESP32** microcontroller in combination with the **Ai-Thinker A9G** module to retrieve real-time GPS coordinates of the pet and display the location using an **IoT Dashboard**.

The primary motivation for this project is the growing number of lost pets, especially in a post-pandemic world. This solution is cost-effective and provides accurate location tracking in real-time.

## Objective

The key objectives of the **Smart Collar for Pet Tracking** project are:
- To build an affordable pet tracker with an extended range and precise GPS tracking.
- To ensure the safety of pets and provide real-time tracking to the owner via a mobile app or dashboard.

## Features

- **Real-Time GPS Tracking**: Retrieve the pet’s GPS coordinates using the AI-Thinker A9G module.
- **Wireless Communication**: Use GSM/GPRS for data transmission.
- **IoT Dashboard Integration**: Display the pet's real-time location on an interactive dashboard.
- **Compact Design**: Small and lightweight, suitable to be worn on a pet's collar.
- **Battery Powered**: Portable design with battery support for long-term usage.

## Components Used

- **ESP32 WROOM Module**: For microcontroller functionality.
- **AI-Thinker A9G**: GPS/GPRS module used for tracking.
- **IoT Dashboard**: Used to display real-time location data.

## Performance Metrics

- **GPS Accuracy**: Provides accurate real-time location with a precision of about 2.5 meters.
- **Battery Life**: Optimized for low power consumption, allowing several hours of continuous tracking.
- **Transmission Speed**: Location data updates every 15-20 seconds via GPRS to the IoT dashboard.

### Results

- **Real-Time Location**: The smart collar successfully tracked the pet's location and displayed it on the **Traccar IoT dashboard**.
- **Compact and Lightweight Design**: The final product is compact enough to be comfortably worn by pets.
